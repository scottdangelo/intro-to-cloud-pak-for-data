## Architecture

IBM® Cloud Pak for Data is composed of pre-configured microservices that run on a multi-node IBM Cloud Private cluster. The microservices enable you to connect to your data sources so that you can catalog and govern, explore and profile, transform, and analyze your data from a single web application.

Cloud Pak for Data is deployed on a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, using RedHat OpenShift. Although you can deploy Cloud Pak for Data on a 3-node cluster, it is strongly recommended that you deploy your production environment on a cluster with at least 6 nodes for better performance, better cluster stability, and increased ease of scaling the cluster to support workload growth.
